# KISTLER FAAM Machine Data Extraction GUI

## üìÑ Project Overview

This project provides a GUI tool for extracting and analyzing data from CSV files generated by KISTLER FAAM machines. Users can filter the data based on batch details, time ranges, and file contents, and visualize the data through graphical plots.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Data Extraction**: Efficiently extracts data from batch folders within specified time ranges and machine selections.
- **Filtering Options**: Filter results by OK, NOK, or both, with an optional random sampling feature.
- **Graph Plotting**: Generate visual graphs of extracted data, with customizable time intervals.
- **Save Output**: Export extracted data and graphs to an Excel file with embedded images for easy sharing and reporting.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.x**
- Libraries:
  - `pandas`
  - `openpyxl`
  - `glob`
  - `os`
  - `time`
  - `plotnine`
  - `tkinter`

### Install Dependencies

To install required dependencies, run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## üöÄ Running the Application
To launch the GUI:
   - `python main.py`

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use

- **Select Machine**: Choose between FAAM_1 and FAAM_2.
- **Enter SO Number**: Provide the Sales Order (SO) number for batch extraction.
- **Select Time Range**: Specify the start and end time for data extraction.
- **Select Final Result**: Filter data based on OK, NOK, or both results.
- **Random Sampling**: Optionally, choose to sample random files from the extracted data.
- **Time Interval**: If random sampling is not used, choose the time interval for graph plotting.
- **Run**: Click the Run button to start the extraction process. The results will be saved in an Excel file with graphs.
