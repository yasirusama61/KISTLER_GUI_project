## 📄 Project Overview

This project provides a GUI tool for extracting and analyzing data from CSV files generated by KISTLER FAAM machines. Users can filter the data based on batch details, time ranges, and file contents, and visualize the data through graphical plots.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Data Extraction**: Efficiently extracts data from batch folders within specified time ranges and machine selections.
- **Filtering Options**: Filter results by OK, NOK, or both, with an optional random sampling feature.
- **Graph Plotting**: Generate visual graphs of extracted data, with customizable time intervals.
- **Save Output**: Export extracted data and graphs to an Excel file with embedded images for easy sharing and reporting.

## 📊 Data Analysis

### 📈 Combined EO Sensor Data Distribution

![Combined EO Sensor Distribution](snapshots/combined_eo_distribution.png)

This plot showcases the distributions of measurements for all EO sensors (EO-01, EO-02, EO-03, EO-05, EO-07) used in the FAAM machine for autoinjector assembly. Analyzing the data across all sensors provides a comprehensive view of their behavior, allowing quick identification of trends, deviations, and potential anomalies across the production line.

#### Key Insights

- **Normal Operating Range** 🎯: This distribution establishes baseline ranges for each sensor's measurements, helping to quickly identify deviations.
- **Threshold Markers** 🚦: High and low threshold lines (dashed) for each sensor denote the acceptable operational range. Values beyond these thresholds may signal potential outliers or abnormal behavior.
- **Anomaly Detection** 🛑: By viewing all sensors together, it’s easier to spot patterns or unusual values across multiple measurements, which could indicate emerging issues.

### 📊 Interpretation of Combined Sensor Plot

- **Cross-Sensor Analysis** 🔍: Analyzing all sensors in one plot enables systemic insight, allowing the detection of potential issues affecting multiple machine components.
- **Anomalies and Outliers** 📛: Values outside of threshold lines are flagged for review, supporting quality control and consistency within the assembly process.
- **Real-Time Monitoring** ⏱️: This plot can be updated in real-time to capture any sensor behavior shifts over time, supporting proactive maintenance and quality assurance.

This combined sensor view is essential for continuous monitoring of overall machine health, ensuring all EO sensors operate within expected ranges and facilitating quick detection of potential production line issues.
